- Let us simplify the powering circuit. 
As shown in the diagram below. also add a 
provision for an extra battery in parallel
- Power all modules through a high side mosfet. 
This way users can easily turn off the modules 
they are not using. All power supplies to the header pins should be controlled
 from a common mosfet switch too. Currently the battery drains too fast - PARTIALLY DONE
- Relay mosfets were not working, because the gate resistance 
was too big. Please use 100ohm resistor in the gate and increase
 the pull down resistor to 100k - DONE
- Use different LED colors for indication. Currently they are 
all blue - DONE
- Replace the battery low monitor with the voltage divider
 circuit we used on the aquarech board. - DONE
- Add GND screw terminal on the RS485 port - DONE
- Change the Geviton Logo to the new one. please check
